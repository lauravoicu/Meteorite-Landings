The Meteoritical Society collects data on meteorites that have fallen to Earth from outer space. This dataset includes the location, mass, composition, and fall year for over 45,000 meteorites that have struck our planet and was downloaded from NASA's Data Portal. The notebook includes a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on this dataset.

What can we do with this data?
Here are a couple of thoughts on questions to ask and ways to look at this data:

- how do the observed falls differ from that of found meteorites?
- are there any geographical differences or differences over time in the class of meteorites that have fallen to Earth?
